I’m a dog dad, BBA, and a Software Developer who has taken full-stack applications from conception to production. In 2022 I started my coding journey as a student in the Get Coding program. Just before completing the program, I was hired by the company to build their custom student management system, and later also became a coach.

In addition to working with Get Coding, I had an opportunity to contribute to the development of a mobile application at Milk Moovement for a short time in 2023. I've also worked in a number of public-sector areas in the past including healthcare, education/IT, and municipal government.

In my free time, I continue to work on personal projects and volunteer with Canada Learning Code when I can!
