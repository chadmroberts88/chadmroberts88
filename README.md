I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer with a degree in Business. I've also worked in a number of public-sector areas in the past including healthcare, education/IT, and municipal government.

I started my software development journey in late 2021. In early 2022 I joined [Get Coding](https://github.com/getcoding-ca). Before finishing the program, I was hired by the company as a developer to build both the mobile and web versions of their student management system.
